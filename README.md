# PYTHON GUIDE #2

## Else After For
The else function after for is a function that takes precedence in search loops to provide a program exit when the search is not found.

## Break
- The break statement stops the loop and then exits, followed by executing the statement after the loop block
- If you have a nested loop, break will stop the loop according to the level or loop it is in
- However, if it is placed in a second depth loop, for example, only that loop stops, not the main loop

## Continue
- The continue statement will make the current iteration stop
- Then proceed to the next iteration
- Ignore statements that are between continue and the end of the loop block

## While Loop
- While in the Python language is used to execute a statement as long as a given condition is met (True)
- The condition can be any expression, and please remember that True in python includes all non-zero values
- When the condition becomes False, the program will continue to the line after the statement block

## List Comprehension
- There are times when we need to create a new list from the previous list operation.
- List Comprehension is a way to generate new lists based on existing lists or iterables

- Underscore includes valid variable names
- In general "_" is usually used as a throwaway variable (unimportant variable)

## Function
- In mathematics, a function is a process that relates between an input (input) and an output (output)
- In Python, apart from these relational functions, functions are also a way to organize code - with the ultimate goal of code being reusable.
- It is best if functions only have one specific use but can be reused.
- Common functions are provided by Python.
- But we can always define our own functions.

By default, Python will position each parameter according to the order in which they were registered when they were defined, and must be called in that order.

## Return
The return keyword is to exit a function and return a value.
